- What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the database with the repository info (files incldued, commits, history, etc.).

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value does it offer?

Staging area includes work-in-progress controlled files (before they are committed, or being changed but not ready to commit).

Working directory also contains current version of controlled files, but also it may contain other files that are not controlled: they will never be included in any commit.

The respository includes snapshots of controlled files, once they are deemed ready to be controlled. They establish a baseline. It includes all successive commits (history).
